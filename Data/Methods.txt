Method 5
The next method to be discussed is based on using additional replicated measurements. If additional
replications are collected in a sensible way, the variances of the whole-plot and the sub-plot errors can be
estimated using simple variance formulae. Such an approach was described in, for instance, Kowalski et al.5.
One of the advantages of this approach is that the estimated error variances are totally model-independent.
The disadvantage is that more experiments have to be carried out.
Sub-plot replicates can often be obtained easily by just replicating some of the sub-plot combinations for
a given whole-plot configuration. If variances are different for the different whole-plot combinations, it is
recommended that this procedure is repeated for a number of whole-plot combinations.With r different wholeplot
combinations and with m different sub-plot combinations within each of them, the sub-plot error variance
estimate can be written as
S2
sp
= 1
r

r
i=1

m
j=1(yij − ¯yi.)2
m − 1
(8)
Here, yij is the response measurement for whole-plot combination i and sub-plot combination j and ¯yi. is the
average of yij over j . For whole-plot variance estimation, however, the situation is different. Making replicates
involving only the whole-plot error is difficult to envision because all replicates will always involve a
contribution from the residual random (here sub-plot) error. At least measurement error will always be present,
even if sub-plot combinations can be kept in exactly the same position during the experimentation.
A possible approach for estimating the whole-plot variance estimation is the following. Select one
combination of the experimental variables and repeat it r times, each time by resetting both the whole-plot and
sub-plot factors between each experiment. These replicates will then be identical except for the total random
noise in the experiment, which is equal to δ + e and has variance equal to σ2

sp. The total error
variance can be estimated using the simple formula
ˆσ

tot
=

i=1
(yi − ¯y)2/(r − 1) (9)
This can, as for the sub-plot variance, be repeated for a number of experimental settings and pooled to give a
more precise estimate. The whole-plot error variance can then be computed by subtracting the sub-plot variance

A problem with this approach, however, is that it is not obvious how to find the distribution of the error variances
in V and their DFs, which are needed for testing purposes. For the situation with many replicates, this is not a
major problem. The reason is that the estimated elements of V can then be assumed known.
Another approach, which can be used to provide both whole-plot and sub-plot variances simultaneously, is
to use a hierarchical design strategy. First, a whole-plot combination is selected and then this combination is
reset a number of times (r). For each of these ‘resets’, the same sub-plot combination is repeated a number of
times (m). The data will then contain information only about the noise structure and can be modelled as
yij = μ + Ai + eij (11)

where Ai corresponds to the whole-plot random error and eij to the sub-plot error. The expected whole-plot
MS for this model is equal to the same expression as in Equation (6). The variances of the two errors can be
estimated using the standard ANOVA formulae.

where MSwp and MSsp are the mean squares for the two effects in model (11). The two MSs have DFs equal to
(r − 1) and m(r − 1), respectively.
An advantage with this hierarchical approach is that the number of sub-plot replicates m can in some cases
be chosen in such a way that the expectations of the MSs are exactly equal to the variance elements of
cov( ˆbGLS) = (XTV−1X)
−1. This means that estimates for the error variances used in the tests will have known
distribution and can be used directly for testing purposes.We will comment further on this topic in Section 7 in
the first of the examples.
